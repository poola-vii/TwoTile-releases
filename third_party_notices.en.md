## .NET runtime and libraries

TwoTile is built with .NET 10 and **includes the .NET runtime and libraries it needs to run** (self-contained). You don't need to install .NET separately.

The .NET source code is published under the MIT License, with the same text as Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection above (`Copyright (c) .NET Foundation and Contributors`).

Redistribution of the included runtime is subject to the [.NET Library License](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet_library_license.htm). In line with it, §7 of the [Terms of Use](terms.en.md) includes terms that protect Microsoft and .NET. In summary:

- Microsoft makes **no warranties** about .NET and isn't liable for any damages.
- You won't reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble .NET (except to the extent applicable law expressly permits it).
- If you redistribute TwoTile, **you must have recipients agree to terms that protect Microsoft and .NET at least as much.**
